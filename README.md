## Description

The goal for this collaboration was to design an application that was not only fuctional and dynamic, but to develop something that was actually useful to us. Using the knowledge we have learned so far and through our collaborative efforts, we have developed an application that will help its users find where their favorite entertainment content is streamed. Users will no longer have to search through several streaming applications searching for their favorite content before actually finding it. The user only needs to enter which show or movie they wish to stream and our application will not only provide information about where that content it currently available for stream but will also provide basic information and background on that content. In addition, the user can also use our application to see what is currently on IMDB's top ten most popular list for content recommendations. 

Collaboration, teamwork, and communication were all important tools we had to utilize to bring this application to fruition. We were able to achieve our goal of developing this applicaiton by always keeping open channels of communication and a detailed gameplan of what each team members duties and tasks were. If there was a problem that one of our teammates was having trouble will the other teammates wer ready to jump in to assist with solving the problem.
